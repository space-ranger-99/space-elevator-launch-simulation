# space-elevator-launch-simulation
A MATLAB script that simulates the post-launch dynamics of a spacecraft released from a simplified space elevator at various initial altitude offsets from geostationary orbit. It calculates the altitude and velocity of the spacecraft over time and generates plots to visualize the results.
